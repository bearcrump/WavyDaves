This is a list of modules I will be using while developing this app. They will be listed here.
Part of Go's compiler optimization removes all unused code / modules meaning I cannot import them in their own respective files


## List

* "net/http" - standard library http client
* "database/sql" - standard library sql package
* github.com/lib/pq - postgresql driver
